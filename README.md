# energy-consumption
An analysis of the energy consumption of London households between 2011 and 2014.


## About the dataset

The data contains a sample of energy consumption readings for 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. It can be found on the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households).

Readings were taken at half hourly intervals. The customers in the trial were recruited as a balanced sample representative of the Greater London population.

Within the data set are two groups of customers. The first is a sub-group, of approximately 1100 customers, who were subjected to Dynamic Time of Use (dToU) energy prices throughout the 2013 calendar year period. The tariff prices were given a day ahead via the Smart Meter IHD (In Home Display) or text message to mobile phone. Customers were issued High (67.20p/kWh), Low (3.99p/kWh) or normal (11.76p/kWh) price signals and the times of day these applied. The dates/times and the price signal schedule is available as part of this dataset. All non-Time of Use customers were on a flat rate tariff of 14.228p/kWh.

The signals given were designed to be representative of the types of signal that may be used in the future to manage both high renewable generation (supply following) operation and also test the potential to use high price signals to reduce stress on local distribution grids during periods of stress.

The remaining sample of approximately 4500 customers energy consumption readings were not subject to the dToU tariff.

The version of the dataset used in this project was collected and enriched by Jean-Michel D and [uploaded to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london).

Some metadata describing the demographics of the study population are also available. CACI UK segmented the households into demographic types, referred to as Acorn groups. The Acorn classes (Lavish Lifestyles, City Sophisticates, Student Life, and so on) are grouped into parent classes (Affluent Achievers, Rising Prosperity, Financially Stretched, and so on). Full details on the classification system can be found in the [Acorn User Guide](https://www.caci.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Acorn-User-Guide-2020.pdf).
